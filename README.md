Complete program for Bank of IIT that parses data from bank-Detail.csv, which contains valuable raw data to allow the bank to process loans based on client details from the file.
An abstract class, Client.java, allows for the creation of three abstract methods used by the bank to readData(), processData(), and printData().  BankRecords.java uses the Client abstract methods to generate client records from the csv file.  BankRecordsTest.java allows for the testing and output of the parsed information.
